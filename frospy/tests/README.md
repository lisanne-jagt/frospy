To run the tests create test functions according to this example:

https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html#assert


Each file has to begin with 'test', e.g. 'test_foo.py', so do the functions.
Put reference data (as small as possible) in nmpy/tests/data, so the input is always known

Run tests using 

'''
bash run_tests.sh
'''
